Developed and utilized an emulation-based system for distributed file storage and parallel computation. The project consists of three major tasks: 
(1) building an emulated distributed file system (EDFS); 
(2) implementing partition-based map and reduce (PMR) on
data stored on EDFS for search/analytics function in task 3;
(3) creating an app that uses the implemented PMR methods.
